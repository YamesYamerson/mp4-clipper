For browser-based video editing, WebAssembly (Wasm) paired with a modern JavaScript framework like React, or a combination like Remotion offers the best combination of performance and flexibility. This allows for features comparable to desktop video editors, while still providing a web-based experience. 
Elaboration:

    WebAssembly (Wasm):
    Wasm is a binary instruction format for the web that allows for near-native speed performance of code on web browsers. This is crucial for demanding tasks like video editing. 

JavaScript Frameworks (React, etc.):
Frameworks like React provide a robust way to build user interfaces and manage complex video editing logic within the browser. 
Remotion:
Remotion is a React-based framework specifically designed for programmatic video creation and editing. It leverages React's declarative syntax for easier video management and provides a UI for previewing and editing, while also allowing for integration with custom UIs, making it suitable for various project types. 
Why this combination?
The combination of Wasm and a JavaScript framework allows for a powerful, high-performance browser-based video editing experience. This approach enables developers to leverage the speed of Wasm for rendering and processing while using a familiar and flexible framework like React to build the user interface and manage video editing functionalities. 

Other notable technologies:

    JavaScript Video Editing Libraries:
    Various libraries, like those listed on GitHub, provide tools for programmatic video creation and manipulation within JavaScript. 

Open Source Video Editors:
While some open-source video editors, like OpenShot, primarily focus on desktop applications, some can be adapted or integrated with web-based tools. 

Key Considerations for Choosing:

    Performance:
    Wasm is essential for handling the processing demands of video editing within a browser environment. 

Flexibility:
A JavaScript framework provides a robust foundation for building custom user interfaces and features. 
Ease of Development:
Remotion, for instance, simplifies video creation and editing through its React-based approach.
